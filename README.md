# QuoteTabs
QuoteTabs is a Chrome Extension that displays a random quote related to math or computer science on new tabs. It pulls the quotes from one of three random quote APIs.

# How to Use
I haven't publish this on the Chrome Web Store, but you can still use it if you would like. All you have to do is:
1. Download the code from this repo to your local machine.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ on Google Chrome.
3. Click on Load Unpacked then select the folder where QuoteTabs is located.
4. Enjoy your quotes on every new tab!
